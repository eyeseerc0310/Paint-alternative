# Paint Alternative: notes for Claude

A browser painting app (plain HTML/CSS/JS, no build step), published with
GitHub Pages from `main`. The app is `index.html`, `style.css` and `paint.js`;
`sw.js`, `manifest.webmanifest` and `icons/` make it installable and offline.

## Design: use one shared design system

The owner wants a **shared design system**, not components styled one by one.
Every new feature must inherit the same colours, spacing, corner radii,
shadows and interaction behaviour automatically.

When building or changing anything visual:

- **Use the shared tokens** (CSS custom properties on `:root` in `style.css`,
  redefined for dark mode under `:root[data-theme="dark"]`). Colours: `--bg`,
  `--text`, `--muted`, `--line`, `--accent`, `--accent-hover`,
  `--accent-soft`, `--hover`, `--panel`, `--panel-solid`, `--menu-*`. Shadows:
  `--shadow-panel`, `--shadow-pop`. Glass: `--glass`. Radii: `--r-panel`,
  `--r-btn`. Don't hard-code a colour, radius, shadow or spacing value in a
  component. If a value you need doesn't exist yet, add it as a token
  (spacing, radius, type size, motion and so on) so later features can reuse it.
- **Reuse shared component styles** for the same kind of thing (buttons,
  pills, menus and pop-overs, sheets, segmented controls, sliders, rows),
  rather than writing new one-off rules. Give new components the shared
  classes, and add a variant only when something truly differs.
- **Keep interaction behaviour consistent:** the same hover, pressed
  (slight scale), focus, disabled and selected states everywhere. Selected
  tools and list items use a neutral rounded outline, not the accent.
  The accent (red) is for primary actions (Save, Done, Create) and the
  chosen colour.
- **Test in light and dark mode and at phone width** (560px and narrower).
- Much of the existing CSS predates this rule and has repeated values. Don't
  refactor it unless asked. Move things onto shared tokens and styles as you
  touch them, and keep unrelated changes out of a task.
